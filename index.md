## About me

My diversified career has allowed me to develop a wide array of managerial and sales skills,
and I always look forward to keep broadening my expertise and satisfy my customers well beyond
their expectations!

I enjoy very much working with people and, at the same time, I have a very entrepreneurial mindset.
I see myself as a key asset to make my company stronger and more profitable.

During my career, I have had both customer-facing as well as manager roles.
What I learned in the former always made me better in the latter, and vice versa.

Three adjectives that best summarize myself at work? *Hard-working*, *goal-oriented*,
and *over-achieving*!
Let me add a fourth one: *team-leader*.

New challenges and new roles make me very enthusiastic, and I always keep an open mind to learn
as much as possible from every experience and from each of my colleagues.
Together with my positive attitude, this is the secret ingredient of my success!

## Work experience

`Nov 2017 - present` *Assistant Store Manager* @ [Calzedonia](https://world.calzedonia.com/home.jsp)'s NYC 5th Ave Flagship Store.

`Jul 2017 - Nov 2017` *Keyholder* @ [Calzedonia](https://world.calzedonia.com/home.jsp)'s NYC 5th Ave Flagship Store.

`Nov 2016 - Jul 2017` *Brand Specialist* @ [Lacoste](https://www.lacoste.com/us/homepage)'s NYC Macy's Herald Square Boutique.

In November 2016, I was offered the opportunity to fill a position at the Lacoste boutique
inside of the Herald Square Macy's.
This position required a leader with a good understanding of the department store business.
I felt very strongly that my previous work experience at Macy's, combined with my recent
Sales Supervisor role at Lacoste, represented the perfect combination.
So, I accepted with enthusiasm!

This position was a great opportunity to learn more the wholesale side of the Lacoste business
and, at the same time, an exciting new challenge as a Lacoste leader!

`Jul 2016 - Nov 2016` *Sales Supervisor* @ [Lacoste](https://www.lacoste.com/us/homepage)'s One World Trade Center Boutique.

My first exciting opportunity after moving from my hometown, Pittsburgh PA, to NYC!

I led a fantastic group of people and opened the brand new boutique located in the
Westfield Mall (One World Trade Center).
In this experience, I became a Lacoste expert and I further developed my retail business
skills as well as my ability to effectively supervise and bring together a strong team.

`Oct 2014 - Jun 2016` *Empowered Sales Associate* @ [Macy's](https://www.macys.com); Ross Park Mall, Ross Township, PA.

I am proud to have worked at the largest Macy’s store in Western PA!
I worked in the Men’s Furnishing department, but I also supported other departments such as
the Suits department, the Juniors’, and the Young Men’s.

Everyday, I helped my customers finding the perfect outfit by selecting the best items and by
choosing among brands such as Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, just to name a few.
Additional activities that I performed daily include managing customers’ orders, training new hires,
and exceeding the expectations of my customers
(and making sure that even those who came in with a complaint or a special request were fully
satisfied about their shopping experience before leaving).

`Apr 2009 - Jun 2016` *Stand Leader* @ [JD's Olde Fashioned Popcorn](https://www.facebook.com/JDsPopcorn/); Pittsburgh, PA.

JD’s Olde-Fashioned Popcorn is a family owned and operated business, specializing in gourmet
popcorn and candied nuts.

I worked with JD’s every baseball season since 2009 as the leader of one of their two stands
located at the PNC Park (the Pittsburgh Pirates’ home baseball stadium; go Pirates!!!).
There, I was responsible for the on-site production which is based on real-time demand.
I supervised the other employees in the stand and I reported directly to the owners regarding
the stand’s profitability and performance.

`Oct 2012 - Jul 2015` *Sales Support* @ [Victoria's Secret](http://victoriassecret.com); Ross Park Mall, Ross Township, PA.

Just like every other woman, I have always loved Victoria’s Secret! :D

My professional experience with the company was a very exciting one.
I supported the store with all of its main merchandising activities and, in particular,
I focused on duties such as unpacking inbound shipped items and organizing them on the
sales floor.

`Mar 2014 - Oct 2014` *Store Manager* @ [Rita's Italian Ice](https://www.ritasice.com); Kennedy Township, PA.

My experience at Rita’s was an unforgettable one!
I had the responsibility of managing the Kennedy Township store while, at the same time,
overseeing two other stores (one located in Scott Township and the other in the Castle Shannon Borough).

Rita’s store managers are in charge of hiring and training.
My duties also included supervising and assisting the store employees, as well as being
responsible for all the paperwork and the bookkeeping associated with the store’s business.

`Oct 2005 - Jul 2012` *Store Manager* @ [T-Bone's Marketplace](http://www.tbonesmarketplace.com); Wexford, PA.

T-Bone's (http://tbonesmarketplace.com) was my first work experience, and a very successful one!
At the age of 19, I was promoted to Store Manager and I was put in charge of all of the store’s
main activities.
I had the responsibility of making sure that all of the store departments were operating effectively
and efficiently on their tasks.
I also devoted part of my work day to training new hires on the cash register, as well as to dealing
with any issues arising during the store’s hours of operation.

Being a manager in a company requires leadership, of course. However, the willingness to take on
additional duties and working a more intense schedule are also extremely important factors.
For example, in order to be as effective as possible handling the high volume of customers that
the store had during the daytime, I used to perform all of my bookkeeping activities at night.
